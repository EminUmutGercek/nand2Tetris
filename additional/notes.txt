You can think of the RAM as an array of cells (or registers, or boxes).
The number of cell that you can have depend on how many bits are in the address: address with k bits can point to 2^k different positions.
This is called the "length" of the RAM.


Cache RAM is there so that the CPU can get to commonly used data as fast as possible.
Cache RAM is usually the same width as the CPU. System RAM can be various widths, and if necessary, multiple reads can occur to assemble the data into a CPU width word.
The CPU must be able to wait for the memory controller to do it's work.
One of the reasons for this is the speed of light limitation. 
If the CPU is running at 1 Ghz, the cycle time is 1 ns (1x10^-9 s) in this time information can only travel 30 cm!
The main memory may too far from the CPU for addresses to get to the RAM and data to get back before the CPU needs it.
